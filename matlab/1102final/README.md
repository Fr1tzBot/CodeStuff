### Todo List:
- [ ] prompt user to enter a size to be scaled up to
- [ ] custom recipe input
- [x] hopulator code
- [ ] confirm outputs (all for scaled up batch):
    - [x] how many barrels of beer is produced
    - [x] lbs uncrushed & crushed grain
    - [x] gallons of mash water added
    - [x] gallons of sparge water added
    - [x] gallons of wort into boil
    - [x] lbs of hops added to the boil
    - [x] length of boil
    - [x] total IBUs in a batch
    - [x] gallons of wort whirlpooled
    - [x] gallons of trub created
    - [x] gallons of wort chilled
    - [x] gallons of wort into fermenter
    - [x] yeast in fermenter
    - [x] maltose in fermenter
    - [ ] final %abv
        - currently broken
    - [ ] graphs:
        - [ ] yeast concentration vs time
        - [ ] sugar concentration vs time
        - [ ] alchohol concentration vs time
        - [ ] CO2 concentration vs time
- [ ] comments Everywhere
    - need em in ferment code
- [ ] at least one thing turning on and one off for each stage in the process
    - need two added leds for mash and storage?
- [ ] make pump do something
    - [ ] leds indicating pump direction
- [ ] make gauge indicate something
- [ ] make an algorithm for boil evap and top up water
