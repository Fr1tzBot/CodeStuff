### Todo List:
- [x] prompt user to enter a size to be scaled up to
- [ ] custom recipe input
- [x] hopulator code
- [x] confirm outputs (all for scaled up batch):
    - [x] how many barrels of beer is produced
    - [x] lbs uncrushed & crushed grain
    - [x] gallons of mash water added
    - [x] gallons of sparge water added
    - [x] gallons of wort into boil
    - [x] lbs of hops added to the boil
    - [x] length of boil
    - [x] total IBUs in a batch
    - [x] gallons of wort whirlpooled
    - [x] gallons of trub created
    - [x] gallons of wort chilled
    - [x] gallons of wort into fermenter
    - [x] yeast in fermenter
    - [x] maltose in fermenter
    - [x] final %abv
        - currently not reasonable but it is there
    - [x] graphs:
        - [x] yeast concentration vs time
        - [x] sugar concentration vs time
        - [x] alchohol concentration vs time
        - [x] CO2 concentration vs time
- [ ] comments Everywhere
    - need em in ferment code
- [ ] at least one thing turning on and one off for each stage in the process
    - need two added leds for mash and storage?
- [ ] make pump do something
    - [ ] leds indicating pump direction
- [ ] make gauge indicate something
- [ ] make an algorithm for boil evap and top up water
