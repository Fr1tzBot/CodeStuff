# CodeStuff
A repository with various code stuff and things

This is just a random assortment of code, so one file probably won't correspond to another.

I <ins>don't</ins> recommend using any of this code for anything other than messing around, as there could be serious bugs and/or security problems.

Also, feel free to recommend fixes to the code, but I only work on this in my free time, so I probably won't see it for a while.

Also, check out some of my projects [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ "github.com")
