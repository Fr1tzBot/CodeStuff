# mtuFlow

A tool for creating and verifying class flow charts

## Features:
- [ ] checks graduation requirements
- [ ] ensures all pre requisites are met
- [ ] ensures classes are offered in the given semester
- [ ] checks for class conflicts (?)
- [ ] interactive flowchart building gui/tui
- [ ] written in rust for ludicrous speed :)
- [ ] tests?

## Current issues:
- [ ] replace eval() usage with a parser (not necessary for release)
- [ ] build some kind of caching to keep speed up (push scraped data to json db)
- [x] deal with test score prereqs and other oddball exceptions

will be moved to its own repo if/when these current issues are fixed
